Tcll - After a recent hard drive failure, I'm currently left without the working code that 
was intended to be uploaded here once everything was properly re-structured for public editing.

Instead I'm left having to work on an old, but relatively recent backup that was made some time ago...
I'm only uploading here because I can't trust my hardware anymore, and I'm sick of losing my work.

Please do not edit until this file is deleted.
or if you intend to make edits, please discuss them with me over on either my discord server, or a DM.
email me if you need my discord info.
