After a recent hard drive failure, I'm currently left without the working code that was intended to be uploaded here once everything was properly re-structured for public editing.

Instead I'm left having to work on an old, but relatively recent backup that was made some time ago...<br>
I'm only uploading here because I can't trust my hardware anymore, and I'm sick of losing my work.
